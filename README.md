Cotton2K is a cotton simulation model specially adapted for irrigated cotton production in arid regions. It was originally written by [Prof. Avishalom Marani][], and rewrite in Python by [Tang Ziya][].

The model software is distributed under AGPL 3.0 or later. This version has been upgraded to run on Python.

Issue is welcome.
